This repo contains project related to predicting bihar vidhan sabha election results with the help of Sentiment analysis and SNA.
**Note: There are some data inconsistency like INC and Congress treated as different entities but even after that the top 3 ranking remains unchanged.
Also one leader can have many common names but their connection to the party is handled accordingly. For e.g. tejaswi Yadav and tejaswi_yadav is referred to as RJD.
We used gemini API and perplexity to map all the leader mentioned in the tweets to their respective political parties so there can be chances of mismatch or inconsistency there.
